> Hello World!

Your strong will to advance to the world by introducing a variety of languages into the creative Unity games you creating has led you here!

From simple games with less text to games with more text, you can find the proper localization methods for your project size in this asset.



> ## Q. Great! Now what should I do?

Before getting started, please read "Language Settings" on the left side. If you want to see the examples, play included demo scenes or read "Example Games" in the list.

If your project size and the amount of text size are small so if there's no problem with using memory that texts of all languages, You can use **Localizer Components** and **Localizer Dictionary**.

If you already have csv, tsv, google spreadsheets, You can convert it to Localized Dictionary. Google spreadsheets can load asynchronously in runtime and convert it for use.

**LValue&lt;T&gt;** is value class for supporting localization. You can use it in a variety of situations. Also, you can add custom types besides already defined types. You can find more information on the list.

**Tag Parameter** provides a function that display specific values converted from identifiable tags.

**Localizer Viewer** and **Localizer Manager** are editor window that increase your work convenience.

If your project size and the amount of text size are big \(ex: character quotations, readable collection etc\) so that memory cost is high, You can find **Script** function on left side. This function is a method that save files in each language and load to use when it needed instead of ready to use functions.
